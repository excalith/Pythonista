# Pythonista
In this repo I will share my Python scripts, written for fun through Pythonista App for iOS. Most of them were written on bed, while trying to sleep.

### d20.py
It rolls d20 to help you decide if you have a chance to success on your next whatever-you-do depending on the roll. Note that I am not responsible for your rolls. If anyone to blame, blame your phone.
* If you roll 20, you will have critical success (You will succed more than you should)
* If you roll 1, you will have critical failure (You will suck as much as you can)
* Inbetween those numbers, gradually increase / decrease the success rate according to the logic above.

### Thunder.py
It helps you to calculate the thunder distance from your position. 
* Click start when you see the lightning
* Hit pause when you hear the thunder
* Checkout the distance written in meters
* If required, find shelter.
